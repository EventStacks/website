## The City of Connections

The city being connected across multiple entities.

- Traffic lights changes when cars are detected, or emergency vehicles with priority
- Private solar panels sending back power to the grid
- Street lights turn on and off based on time of the day and other factors
- City hall keeping track of where people are living
- Companies getting updates to when people are moving
- Measuring traffic and patterns
- Trains announcing their arrival and departure
- Train operators managing train schedules
- New buildings announcing they are build and needs power and availability

Building a world where connections are everything, not only everything, they are easily achievable, extendible and integratable. Where things can be replaced as each things has a clear interface.

- Your are able to easily build applications and making them interact with the outside through own AsyncAPI document, or external one.
- You can easily document an application 
- Learn/discover relationships across applications and events and how they relate
- You can easily learn about enterprise/design patterns

### Build

- (must have) Can build applications through design-first
  - (must have) can generate code to ease the implementation phase
    - (must have) Can generate payload structures
    - (must have) Can generate helper functions
    - (must have) Can generate header structures
    - (should have) Can generate full libraries for interacting with an application or as a separate AsyncAPI document
  - (should have) Ensure consistency across applications through governance
  - (should have) Have a platform that enable you to easily create documents through existing components
  - (must have) Can build it with support functions for each IDE (vscode)

- (should have) Can build applications through code
  - Can annotate existing payload classes
  - Can annotate functions as operations
  - Can generate full library for interacting with an application
  - 

### Document
- (must have) Knows which payload to send over a channel
- (must have) Knows which parameters to send over a channel
- (must have) Knows which operations are available
- (must have) Knows which channels/topics are available
- (must have) Knows which servers are available

### Discover
- (must have) Can discover how applications relate over the same channels
- (must have) Can discover how topics are interacted with
- (should have) Can discover how brokers/servers are interacted over by who
- (should have) Can discover relations according to tags
- 

### Learn

- (must have) The city of connections as a playground project for conferences and talks
- (should have) A collection of enterprise/design patterns that is easy to look up
- (should have) Good examples across tooling
